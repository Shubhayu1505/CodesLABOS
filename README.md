# Operating System Lab - Practical Exercises

This repository contains the solutions to the practical exercises related to Operating Systems. Each exercise involves implementing various operating system concepts such as memory allocation, CPU scheduling, file systems, and disk scheduling.

## Exercise List

### 1. Operating System Installation
   a. Installing a Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).  
   b. Understanding the booting process of Linux.

### 2. Linux Commands
   a. Basic Linux commands (e.g., file manipulation, directory navigation, etc.).  
   b. Filters (e.g., `grep`, `sort`, `awk`) and administrative commands (e.g., `sudo`, `chmod`).

### 3. Shell Programming
   - Write and execute basic shell scripts for automation of tasks.

### 4. Process Creation
   - Program to demonstrate process creation and management using system calls like `fork()` in Linux.

### 5. Multithreading
   - Implement a C program to demonstrate multithreading using `pthread`.

### 6. Mutual Exclusion - Semaphore and Reader Writer Solution
   - Program to implement mutual exclusion using semaphores.
   - Solve the Reader-Writer problem to avoid race conditions.

### 7. Dining Philosopher Problem
   - Implement the dining philosopher problem using semaphores to avoid deadlock.
